## Postman Usage Guide

1. Import your API collection in Postman.
2. Create a request to `/register` to sign up.
3. Then use `/login` to retrieve a JWT.
4. Set an environment variable in Postman for `JWT_TOKEN` or add this header to each request:
```
Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN_HERE
```
5. Now you can access protected routes (like creating guests, episodes, etc.).

**Tip**: Save your token in Postman's environment and use `{{JWT_TOKEN}}` in the header.
